# Draft Farmer Questionnaire

This is the main issue for drafting the farmer questionnaire. The questionnaire will be divided into four sections:

1. **Section A: Household & Farm Demographics** (e.g., age of head, education, land size)
2. **Section B: Formal Credit Access** (e.g., have you ever applied for a bank loan? was it approved?)
3. **Section C: Informal Credit Sources** (e.g., access to money lenders, input suppliers on credit, rotating savings groups)
4. **Section D: Machinery & Input Decisions** (this section will define the dependent variable for the Logit model, e.g., "Did you purchase/lease a tractor/tractor-trolley in the last 3 years? Yes/No")

Each section is tracked as a sub‑issue (see files `01‑section‑a‑demographics.md`, `02‑section‑b‑formal‑credit.md`, etc.).

## Purpose
- Collect data on farmer characteristics, credit access, and machinery investment.
- Provide the raw material for the binary Logit model (dependent variable from Section D).
- Enable analysis of how informal vs. formal credit influences mechanization decisions.

## Timeline
- **Week 1:** Finalize questionnaire sections (sub‑issues).
- **Week 2:** Review and pilot with 10 farmers.
- **Week 3:** Incorporate feedback and produce final version.
- **Week 4:** Train enumerators and begin full‑scale data collection.

## Notes
- All questions should be translated into local language(s).
- Skip logic will be implemented in the digital form to reduce respondent burden.
- Ethical considerations: informed consent, anonymity, right to withdraw.
