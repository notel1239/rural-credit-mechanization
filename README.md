# Rural Credit and Mechanization Study

This project investigates the determinants of agricultural machinery acquisition by farmers, with a specific focus on the role of informal credit sources versus formal ones. The primary analysis will use a binary Logit model where the dependent variable is the acquisition of machinery.
